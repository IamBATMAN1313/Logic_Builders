Based on the TechZone project structure, this is a full-stack e-commerce application with a clear separation between client and server. Here's the detailed workflow and folder organization:

Project Overview
TechZone is an e-commerce platform for technology products with separate client (React frontend) and server (Node.js/Express backend) applications.

Server Structure (server)
Core Files
index.js - Main server entry point, configures Express app, middleware, and routes
db.js - Database connection configuration (PostgreSQL)
package.json - Server dependencies and scripts
Folder Organization
/router - API Route Handlers
adminIndexRouter.js - Admin-specific routes aggregator
indexRouter.js - Main user routes aggregator
jwtAuth.js - Authentication routes
Subfolders:

/Admin/ - Admin operations (add/update/delete products, categories, analytics)
add_products_and_category.js
update_product_category.js
upload_product_images.js
/Products/ - Product-related routes
product.js - Individual product details
shop_page.js - Product listings
Search.js - Search functionality
/Cart/ - Shopping cart operations
/filter/ - Product filtering and categorization
allFilter.js - Complex filtering logic
/middlewares - Express Middleware
authorization.js - JWT token verification
errorHandling.js - Error handling
validInfo.js - Input validation
/controller - Business Logic
/Products/ - Product-related business logic
/SQL - Database Scripts
CreateTable.sql - Database schema
database_script.py - Data population scripts
/public - Static Assets
/images/ - Uploaded product and category images
Client Structure (client)
Core Files
App.js - Main React component with routing and state management
index.js - React app entry point
package.json - Client dependencies and scripts
/src/components - React Components
Organization by Feature:
/Admin/ - Admin dashboard components
AddProduct.js - Product creation form
/Products/ - Product-related UI
showAllProducts.js - Product grid display
showAllCategories.js - Category management
UploadForm.js - Image upload component
/Authentication/ - Login/Register components
/Cart/ - Shopping cart UI
/filter/ - Product filtering interface
sidebar.js - Filter controls
/ReUse/ - Shared/common components
/public - Static Assets
index.html - Main HTML template
/images/ - Static images and icons
Workflow & Data Flow
1. Database Layer
PostgreSQL database with tables defined in CreateTable.sql
Key tables: product, product_category, product_attribute, general_user
2. Server API Layer
Express server handles HTTP requests
Routes are organized by feature (products, admin, cart, etc.)
Authentication via JWT tokens
Image uploads handled by multer middleware
3. Client Application
React SPA with routing
Components organized by feature
State management for cart, authentication
Axios for API communication
4. Key Workflows
Product Management:
Admin adds product via AddProduct.js
Form data sent to add_products_and_category.js
Images uploaded via UploadForm.js â†’ upload_product_images.js
Product data stored in database
Product Display:
Client requests products from shop_page.js
Server queries database, populates product details
showAllProducts.js renders product grid
Filtering:
User selects filters in sidebar.js
Filter parameters sent to allFilter.js
Complex SQL queries filter products by category, price, attributes
Filtered results returned to client
This architecture provides clear separation of concerns, with the server handling data operations and the client managing user interface and experience.
