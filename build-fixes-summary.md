## ðŸ§ª Testing Results

### Required Components Validation:
- âœ… Build without CPU/RAM/etc cannot be added to cart
- âœ… Clear warning message shows missing components
- âœ… Button becomes enabled when all required components added

### Multiple RAM Support:
- âœ… Can add multiple Memory/RAM products to same build
- âœ… Button shows "Add More" instead of "Change"
- âœ… All RAM sticks display in build components list

### Build Images:
- âœ… Build cards show placeholder image (React logo)
- âœ… Images load properly without network issues
- âœ… Fallback to placeholder if image fails

## ðŸŽ¯ User Experience

**Before:** Users could add incomplete builds to cart, build images didn't load
**After:** 
- Clear validation prevents incomplete builds from being added
- Helpful messaging guides users to complete their build
- Build images display consistently across all pages
- Multiple RAM sticks can be added without restrictions

The build system now properly validates completeness before cart addition and displays images reliably!
